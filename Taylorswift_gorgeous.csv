Gorgeous,1,Gorgeous
Gorgeous,2,You should take it as a compliment
Gorgeous,3,That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
Gorgeous,4,You should think about the consequence
Gorgeous,5,Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
Gorgeous,6,"And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us"
Gorgeous,7,He's in the club doin' I don't know what
Gorgeous,8,"You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much"
Gorgeous,9,(I hate you so much)
Gorgeous,10,"Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine"
Gorgeous,11,You've ruined my life by not being mine
Gorgeous,12,You're so gorgeous
Gorgeous,13,I can't say anything to your face
Gorgeous,14,'Cause look at your face
Gorgeous,15,And I'm so furious
Gorgeous,16,At you for making me feel this way
Gorgeous,17,But what can I say?
Gorgeous,18,You're gorgeous
Gorgeous,19,You should take it as a compliment
Gorgeous,20,That I'm talking to everyone here but you
Gorgeous,21,And you should think about the consequence
Gorgeous,22,Of you touching my hand in a darkened room
Gorgeous,23,"If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her"
Gorgeous,24,But if you're single that's honestly worse
Gorgeous,25,'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts
Gorgeous,26,"(Honey, it hurts)"
Gorgeous,27,Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
Gorgeous,28,I feel like I might sink and drown and die
Gorgeous,29,You're so gorgeous
Gorgeous,30,I can't say anything to your face
Gorgeous,31,'Cause look at your face
Gorgeous,32,And I'm so furious
Gorgeous,33,At you for making me feel this way
Gorgeous,34,But what can I say?
Gorgeous,35,You're gorgeous
Gorgeous,36,You make me so happy it turns back to sad
Gorgeous,37,There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
Gorgeous,38,And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
Gorgeous,39,"You make me so happy it turns back to sad, yeah"
Gorgeous,40,There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have and
Gorgeous,41,Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats
Gorgeous,42,Alone
Gorgeous,43,Unless you wanna come along
Gorgeous,44,You're so gorgeous
Gorgeous,45,I can't say anything to your face
Gorgeous,46,'Cause look at your face
